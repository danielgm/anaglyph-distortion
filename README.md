anaglyph-distortion
===================

Experiment with Darren Decoursey distorting images for 3D glasses.

Darren provided left and right images of an angry monkey. In the 2013-06-25 sketch, you can move the mouse around to distort the image. Instead of combining pixels from the same point on the left and right image, a horizontal offset is calculated so the depth appears to change.
